Dear water customer:

                       RE: BALANCE DUE @D2 :   $@47
 
     Shown is the amount due to the City for utility services
rendered to you through @D1 billing period (meter reading
on 15th).  We ask that payment be made in full by @D2.            
Please be advised that the above figure could include delinquent
amounts from previous months which could require payment to the
City before @D2.

Very truly yours,
