In this case your intent is to access web services. This can be done with HTTP client.

My earlier posting was concerning the provision of web services. For that you would need to use the BR Web Server. 

You can do both in a single application but the 2 are not the same and they don't overlap in any meaningful way. Remember.. an HTTP transaction consists of an inquiry and a response. The Client initiates the Inquiry, and the server provides the response. 

For HTTP Client, you will need a CA bundle named ca-bundle.crt located in the BR executable directory. This is a batch of top level root certificates from authorized certificate providers. The procedure for obtaining such bundles is described next.

CA Bundle Periodic Updating
From time to time CA root certificates expire just like end-user certificates. So it can be necessary to update your CA bundle as follows:

Download the current root certificate bundle from https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html
It will be named cacert.pem. Rename it to ca-bundle.crt which is what BR will look for.
