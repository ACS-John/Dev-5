Version 113: Fixed a bug in fnExportListviewCSV where it wasn't working under Client Server unless you were using Shell Default Client.

Version 112: Fixed a bug in the progress bar that would cause problems if you are calling it before calling any other fileio functions. (Thanks John Bowman for the Bug Report).
Fixed a bug in fnCalculateHours and made fnClientServer a library function so you can use it in your own programs. (Thanks Laura Smith for these fixes.)

Version 111: Fixed a bug in the CSV Import Dialog that caused a problem on occasion.

Version 110: Added support for Partial Keys (Syntax Example: data\customer.key, name/startdate(5:8)/startdate(1:4)). Fixed fnBuildKey to support the -U uppercase flag for case insensitive indexes. Created a few Unit Tests for some fileio functions.

Version 109: Added support in fnCompare for Drive Letters in File Layouts.

Version 108: Made Index Parsing more robust. It now will no longer get bugged by partial subscript matches. Also, made the subscript names case insensitive. Also, fixed a bug that was preventing the -U uppercase flag for case insensitive indexes from working.

Version 107: Fixed some bugs in fnCalculateHours, thanks Laura Smith for this function.

Version 106: Fixed a bug that prevented fnReadSubs (legacy function) from working.

Version 105: Added "SERIAL" as a synonym for "JULIAN" when specifying the Date on Disk format in the file layout ",DATE(SERIAL)"
Made the $ sign optional in the File Layouts (unless its a G spec. For G spec, if you want to read the G field into a string variable, you still need the $. For all other specs, the spec type determines if its a string field or not.)

Version 104: Added "Check For Updates" functionality. Moved recent changes to FileIOUpdateLog.txt

Version 103: Fixed a bug when exporting data files that had no numbers and data files that had no strings

Version 102: Added optional parameters Mat F$ and mat F to fnSetSubscripts for two arrays that get resized for the data file.

Version 101: Fixed a glitch in the automatic update process when adding an additional key

Version 100: Fixed a bug in the CSV import routine. Thanks Mikhail Zheleznov!!

Version 99: Increased Length used in Export functionality to support fields up to 1000 characters long (matching the ScreenIO limit).

Version 98: Fixed a bug with the automatic Date Handling logic that caused FileIO's automatic updates to crash

Version 97: added fnCalculateHours(timein$,tout$) which returns the hours between timein and tout, which must be passed in as hhmmss

Version 96: Added functions to convert time between American and Military time: fnStandardTime$ and fnMilitaryTime$

Version 95: Fixed a small bug that caused trouble using the SendEmail function when
 fileio is not installed in the default location. Thanks John Bowman!

Version 94:
 Fixed a bug that occasionally caused the Datacrawler to crash when reading large negative values stored in ZD fields.

Version 93:
 Added an option to the Export Listview CSV so that it supports multi-select listviews and exports only the selected rows.

Version 92:
 Fixed a bug introduced in Version 91 that broke layouts with all strings or all numbers (not mixed)

Version 91:
 Date formatting in 4th column in the layout (by Gabriel Bakker and Mikhail Zheleznov)
 for csv export, data crawler, and other FileIO library functions such as:
 fnReadLayoutArrays
 fnReadEntireLayout
 fnOpenFile
 fnExportToCSV
 fnCsvExport
 fnShowData

 For example:
 Specify DATE(YMD) to indicate the date is saved in the file as MDY.
 Specify DATE(JULIAN) if the date is saved in the file as a julian date.

 This automatically integrates with ScreenIO to format the fields as dates automatically when
  you put the controls on your screen. It automatically works in the Data Crawler. And the
  date formats are returned by the fnReadLayout functions.

 Specify your preferred DateFormatDisplay and DateFormatExport in the fileio.ini file.

 Press F6 (View Raw) or F7 (Edit Raw) in the data crawler to bypass date formatting and see the raw disk values.

 FileIO Date Processing works with Automatic Updates, so if you change your file format on disk,
  for example, from DATE(YMD) to DATE(JULIAN) and increase the version number, FileIO will automatically
  update the date format on disk. You'll have to update any programs that work with the date, however, including
  screenIO programs.

 Fixed a bug with fnExportListviewCSV that made it require OPTION 38. It no longer requires OPTION 38.

Version 90:
 Made fnAddToForm into a library function so people can use it in their programs.
 Removed "let" from subscript assignment code resulting in 4 fewer characters per subscript
  resulting in fewer lines of code to run to set them, and faster execution.
  (Thanks Mikhail Zheleznov for both of these contributions)

Version 89:
 Added fnSubstituteStringCode which is like fnSubstituteString but instead of using the file layout it uses a
  list of variables passed in as BR code to the function.

Version 88:
 Added fnSubstituteString(&Message$,LayoutName$,mat F$,mat F) Which takes the passed in record and layout and subsitutes anything it finds
  in the string that matches.
 Fixed EmailSend function to handle CRLFs as well as \n's for CR in the Message String
  Added ability to type ::U or ::L or ::T to Upper, Lower, or Title Case a substitute value in fnSubstituteString

Version 87:
 Fixed DisplayLength of L spec fields to 17.
 Fixed another bug in CSV Export that would fail if there was a quoted string field with a comma in it.

Version 86:
 Fixed it so that mat badreads doesn't error when there are lots of bad records.

Version 85:
 Added option to Save the Selected Columns on CSV export by filename and restore them next time.

Version 84:
 Added option for Select Columns Only.
 Added code to CSV Export so that if Dialog is off and Filename is not given, then
  an unused filename will be generated.
 Fixed bug in reading Rows and Columns during Upgrade Process that caused an error when running in
  Gui Off mode on a Linux Terminal, when doing an update of a file.

Version 83:
 Select Columns on CSV Export. Made Select Columns screen slightly smaller.

Version 82:
 Fixed a minor Bug in Datacrawler

Version 81:
 Improvements to the built in "Compare" (before and after) functionality (formerly called "AuditBR")

Version 80:
 Fixed a bug in CSV Import involving Quoted fields

Version 79:
 Minor Graphical Improvements, Fine Tuned Progress Bar Function

Vesion 78:
 Dramatically improved the Bad Read functionality. If some records cannot be read, FileIO tells you about it and
  asks if you want to see them. If you say "Yes" it displays them in Notepad. This is a big help when writing layouts
  for preexisting files with PD fields in them, because before you just wouldn't know they were gone.

Version 77:
 Made the Progress bar a callable library function, so that you can use it in your own programs. Call fnProgressBar in
  whatever looping code you want to display the progress bar for, give it the percent done. Call fnCloseBar when you're done.

Version 76:
 Custom File Layout Extensions. Special Thanks to John Bowman who wrote nearly all of the code supporting this. Includes a Layout
  Wizard to help you implement it now. Added Filter Box to the Data Crawler. Added Settings for Filter Boxes and Custom Layouts.
  Better Progress Bar for fnUpdate. Many minor improvements. Implemented Update Message instead of the "Create File" message you
   saw before on update.
